Question 1. (20 pts.)
Given the following, analyze the class below and answer the below questions.  This question does NOT require you to write any code.


package org.howard.edu.lsp.studentPortalHelper;

import java.io.*;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;
import java.util.*;

public class StudentPortalHelper {
  // Data cache (in-memory)
  private static final Map<String, String> cache = new HashMap<>();

  // GPA calculation
  public static double computeGPA(List<Integer> grades) {
    if (grades == null || grades.isEmpty()) return 0.0;
    int sum = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int g : grades) { sum += g; count++; }
    double avg = (double) sum / count;
    // simple mapping: 90–100=A=4, 80–89=B=3, etc.
    if (avg >= 90) return 4.0;
    if (avg >= 80) return 3.0;
    if (avg >= 70) return 2.0;
    if (avg >= 60) return 1.0;
    return 0.0;
  }

  // CSV export to disk
  public static void exportRosterToCsv(String filename, List<String> names) {
    try (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(filename))) {
      pw.println("name");
      for (String n : names) {
        pw.println(n);
      }
    } catch (IOException e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to export roster: " + e.getMessage());
    }
  }

  // Email formatting
  public static String makeWelcomeEmail(String studentName) {
    return "Welcome " + studentName + "! Please visit the portal to update your profile.";
  }

  // Date formatting (UI concern)
  public static String formatDateForUi(LocalDate date) {
    return date.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("MM/dd/yyyy"));
  }

  // Payment processing (stub)
  public static boolean processTuitionPayment(String studentId, double amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) return false;
    // pretend to call external gateway...
    return true;
  }

  // Password strength check (security)
  public static boolean isStrongPassword(String pwd) {
    if (pwd == null || pwd.length() < 8) return false;
    boolean hasDigit = false, hasUpper = false;
    for (char c : pwd.toCharArray()) {
      if (Character.isDigit(c)) hasDigit = true;
      if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) hasUpper = true;
    }
    return hasDigit && hasUpper;
  }

  // Ad-hoc caching
  public static void putCache(String key, String value) {
    cache.put(key, value);
  }

  public static String getCache(String key) {
    return cache.get(key);
  }
}

Tasks:
Using one or more Arthur Riel heuristics, analyze whether the StudentPortalHelper class demonstrates high or low cohesion.
a) Should a well-designed class have high or low cohesion?  Explain and defend your answer.  (5 pts.)
Well-designed class should have high cohesion. When you build classes with high cohesion, you're creating code that's focused, maintainable, and predictable. When you open a class you've written, you should immediately understand its single purpose without wading through unrelated methods. This approach will save you time debugging and make your code much easier to modify later when requirements change.


b) Based on your analysis, discuss—only if you believe changes are needed—how you would reorganize or redesign the class to improve its structure. Your answer should (1) identify the class as having high, low or perfect cohesion and (2) describe a general approach to refactoring the class.  If you believe the class already has good cohesion, justify why no changes are necessary. (15 pts)

The class demonstrates very low cohesion. The StudentPortalHelper class violates multiple Arthur Riel heuristics. Start by identifying each distinct responsibility within the class by examining what each method actually does, which will reveal seven separate domains like academic calculations, file operations, and security validation. Then group these related methods into new, focused classes organized by their natural domains, such as AcademicService for GPA calculations and PaymentService for financial transactions. Next, choose clear, descriptive names for each new class that communicate their single purpose while avoiding generic terms like "Helper" or "Utils." For any shared data like the cache, convert it from static to instance-based within a dedicated manager class to ensure proper lifecycle management, and finally maintain appropriate access levels for each method while ensuring they're logically organized in their new homes, resulting in focused, maintainable classes that each serve one clear purpose.
(If you believe the class already has good cohesion, justify why no changes are necessary.)

Question 2. (20 pts.)

Write a class AreaCalculator in the package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2 with the following overloaded methods:  This should be uploaded to your repo.

// Circle area
public static double area(double radius)

// Rectangle area
public static double area(double width, double height)

// Triangle (base & height) area
public static double area(int base, int height)

// Square (side length) area
public static double area(int side)

Requirements:
Each method should compute and return the correct area.
* Circle area: π (use class Math.PI) ? r?
* Rectangle area: width ? height
* Triangle area: ? ? base ? height
* Square area: side?
* For all methods: throw an IllegalArgumentException if any dimension is ≤ 0.

Create a class named Main that invokes each overloaded method statically to produce exactly the following output:

Circle radius 3.0 ? area = 28.274333882308138
Rectangle 5.0 x 2.0 ? area = 10.0
Triangle base 10, height 6 ? area = 30.0
Square side 4 ? area = 16.0

Finally, invoke at least one of the area methods with a value that causes an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.
* Catch the exception using a try/catch block.
* Print an error message to System.out. (Any message is fine.)
Briefly (2–3 sentences as a comment in class Main) explain if overloading or simply use methods with different names, i.e., rectactangleArea, circleArea, etc..

Question 3. 
Given the following, answer the below questions.
(20 pts.)
        
Given:    
A car manufacturer uses Java software to track current vehicles being built. The UML diagram below shows an excerpt of the current software structure. You should assume the presence of other appropriate fields and methods















Each car can be built to one of three trim levels: Base, Luxury or Sport. They can also be configured with an electric or petrol engine. At various points in the manufacturing process the customer can choose to change the trim level. 

Task:
a) Explain in detail why the current structure does or does not support this. (10 pts.)

The current inheritance-based design fundamentally fails to support dynamic trim changes because it locks each car into a specific type hierarchy at creation time. By making Base, Sports, and Luxury subclasses of Car, the system creates rigid, unchangeable objects where a car's trim level becomes part of its immutable identity. This approach leads to combinatorial explosion as you'd need separate subclasses for every trim-engine combination, making the system brittle and impossible to modify at runtime without creating entirely new objects.

b) Describe how to refactor the structure to allow trim-level change for a car to dynamically change.  Hint: How would you modify Car to use composition to solve the problem? (10 pts.)

The refactoring moves from inheritance to composition by treating trim levels as swappable components rather than fixed identities. By creating a TrimLevel interface with concrete implementations and making Car contain a TrimLevel object, we enable dynamic changes through simple setter methods. This strategy pattern approach allows cars to switch trims seamlessly at runtime, eliminates the combinatorial subclass problem, and makes the system extensible—new trims can be added without touching existing code, perfectly supporting the manufacturing requirement for customer trim changes.

Question 4. (30 pts.)

Design and implement a small smart-campus device system showing both class inheritance (concrete classes extend a common abstract class) and interface implementation.

1) Abstract Base Class — Device
The following Device class is partially implemented for you.
You must not modify this code, but you will use it in your subclasses:


package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question4;

public abstract class Device {
  private String id;
  private String location;
  private long lastHeartbeatEpochSeconds;
  private boolean connected;

  // PROVIDED CONSTRUCTOR
  public Device(String id, String location) {
    if (id == null || id.isEmpty() || location == null || location.isEmpty()) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid id or location");
    }
    this.id = id;
    this.location = location;
    this.lastHeartbeatEpochSeconds = 0;
    this.connected = false;
  }

  public String getId() {
    return id;
  }

  public String getLocation() {
    return location;
  }



  public long getLastHeartbeatEpochSeconds() {
    return lastHeartbeatEpochSeconds;
  }

  public boolean isConnected() {
    return connected;
  }

  protected void setConnected(boolean connected) {
    this.connected = connected;
  }

  public void heartbeat() {
    this.lastHeartbeatEpochSeconds = System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000;
  }

  public abstract String getStatus();
}

You will extend this class in your DoorLock, Thermostat, and Camera implementations.
All subclasses must call super(id, location) in their constructors.

2) Capability Interfaces (behaviors only)
Networked

void connect();
void disconnect();
boolean isConnected();

Behavior:
* connect() brings the device online by setting connected = true.
* disconnect() sets connected = false.
* isConnected() reports the current connection state.
(Concrete classes may satisfy this using Device’s protected setter and public getter.)

BatteryPowered

int getBatteryPercent();      // 0..100
void setBatteryPercent(int percent);

Behavior:
* getBatteryPercent() returns current battery %.
* setBatteryPercent(int) updates it; throw IllegalArgumentException if outside 0..100 inclusive.

3) Concrete Devices (must extend Device and implement interfaces)
All fields must be private. Implement methods exactly as specified.

A) DoorLock — extends Device, implements Networked, BatteryPowered
Private fields

private int batteryPercent;

Constructor
public DoorLock(String id, String location, int initialBattery)

* Call super(id, location).
* Initialize battery by calling setBatteryPercent(initialBattery) (enforces 0..100).


Implemented methods

// Networked
@Override public void connect()    { setConnected(true);  }
@Override public void disconnect() { setConnected(false); }
@Override public boolean isConnected() { return super.isConnected(); }

// BatteryPowered
@Override public int getBatteryPercent() { return batteryPercent; }
@Override public void setBatteryPercent(int percent) {
  if (percent < 0 || percent > 100) throw new IllegalArgumentException("battery 0..100");
  this.batteryPercent = percent;
}

// Status
@Override public String getStatus() {
  String connStatus = isConnected() ? "up" : "down";
  return "DoorLock[id=" + getId() + ", loc=" + getLocation() +
         ", conn=" + connStatus + ", batt=" + batteryPercent + "%]";
}

B) Thermostat — extends Device, implements Networked
Private fields

private double temperatureC;

Constructor
public Thermostat(String id, String location, double initialTempC)

* Call super(id, location).
* Initialize temperatureC to initialTempC.

Accessors

public double getTemperatureC();
public void setTemperatureC(double temperatureC);

Implemented methods

// Networked
@Override public void connect()    { setConnected(true);  }
@Override public void disconnect() { setConnected(false); }
@Override public boolean isConnected() { return super.isConnected(); }

// Status
@Override public String getStatus() {
  String connStatus = isConnected() ? "up" : "down";
  return "Thermostat[id=" + getId() + ", loc=" + getLocation() +
         ", conn=" + connStatus + ", tempC=" + temperatureC + "]";
}

C) Camera — extends Device, implements Networked, BatteryPowered

Private fields
private int batteryPercent;

Constructor

public Camera(String id, String location, int initialBattery)

* Call super(id, location).
* Initialize battery by calling setBatteryPercent(initialBattery).




Implemented methods

// Networked
@Override public void connect()    { setConnected(true);  }
@Override public void disconnect() { setConnected(false); }
@Override public boolean isConnected() { return super.isConnected(); }

// BatteryPowered
@Override public int getBatteryPercent() { return batteryPercent; }
@Override public void setBatteryPercent(int percent) {
  if (percent < 0 || percent > 100) throw new IllegalArgumentException("battery 0..100");
  this.batteryPercent = percent;
}

// Status
@Override public String getStatus() {
  String connStatus = isConnected() ? "up" : "down";
  return "Camera[id=" + getId() + ", loc=" + getLocation() +
         ", conn=" + connStatus + ", batt=" + batteryPercent + "%]";
}

4) Provided Driver

Do not modify this file. Your classes must compile and run with it unchanged.


package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question4;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Device lock   = new DoorLock("DL-101", "DormA-1F", 85);
    Device thermo = new Thermostat("TH-202", "Library-2F", 21.5);
    Device cam    = new Camera("CA-303", "Quad-North", 72);

    // === Invalid battery test ===
    System.out.println("\n== Exception test ==");
    try {
      Device badCam = new Camera("CA-404", "Test-Lab", -5);
      System.out.println("ERROR: Exception was not thrown for invalid battery!");
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
      System.out.println("Caught expected exception: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    // === Heartbeat demonstration ===
    System.out.println("\n== Heartbeat timestamps BEFORE ==");
    for (Device d : Arrays.asList(lock, thermo, cam)) {
      System.out.println(d.getId() + " lastHeartbeat=" + d.getLastHeartbeatEpochSeconds());
    }

    lock.heartbeat();
    thermo.heartbeat();
    cam.heartbeat();

    System.out.println("\n== Heartbeat timestamps AFTER ==");
    for (Device d : Arrays.asList(lock, thermo, cam)) {
      System.out.println(d.getId() + " lastHeartbeat=" + d.getLastHeartbeatEpochSeconds());
    }

    // === Base-class polymorphism ===
    List<Device> devices = Arrays.asList(lock, thermo, cam);
    System.out.println("\n== Initial status via Device ==");
    for (Device d : devices) {
      System.out.println(d.getStatus());
    }

    // === Interface polymorphism: Networked ===
    System.out.println("\n== Connect all Networked ==");
    for (Device d : devices) {
      if (d instanceof Networked) {
        ((Networked) d).connect();
      }
    }

    // === Interface polymorphism: BatteryPowered ===
    System.out.println("\n== Battery report (BatteryPowered) ==");
    for (Device d : devices) {
      if (d instanceof BatteryPowered) {
        BatteryPowered bp = (BatteryPowered) d;
        System.out.println(d.getClass().getSimpleName() + " battery = " + bp.getBatteryPercent() + "%");
      }
    }

    // === Final status check ===
    System.out.println("\n== Updated status via Device ==");
    for (Device d : devices) {
      System.out.println(d.getStatus());
    }
  }
}

5) Brief Rationale (2–4 sentences)

* Why is Device defined as an abstract class? 
* How do the Networked and BatteryPowered interfaces add behavior to your concrete classes?
* Is this design an example of multiple inheritance in Java? Explain why or why not.

The device is abstract because it provides shared state and behavior while requiring subclasses to implement their own status logic. **The interfaces** add specific capabilities through well-defined contracts, allowing devices to selectively implement only needed behaviors. **This design uses** multiple interface implementation but not true multiple inheritance, since Java only permits extending one class. **The approach gives** flexibility without the complexity of multiple class inheritance, enabling polymorphic treatment through both the abstract class and interfaces.

Question 5 (10 pts)
Reflection on AI Use in Learning and Problem Solving
Discuss your personal experience using AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or others) before and during this course.
In your response, address the following points:
1. How have you used AI to support your learning or programming in this course?
2. What benefits or limitations did you encounter?
3. Looking ahead, how do you expect AI to influence the way you solve problems academically or professionally?
Your answer should be 1–2 well-developed paragraphs.
Throughout this semester, I've been using AI tools like ChatGPT mostly as a study buddy when I got stuck on programming concepts or midterm review problems. Like when we were working on the AreaCalculator assignment, I used it to double-check my understanding of method overloading versus just using different method names. It was really helpful for explaining why IllegalArgumentException was the right choice for our error handling. I'd try to solve problems on my own first, then use AI to fill in the gaps in my understanding—kind of like having a TA available 24/7.
The biggest benefit was definitely getting instant feedback when I was studying late at night before exams. But I did notice sometimes the AI would overcomplicate simple problems or miss specific requirements if I didn't word my questions carefully. Looking forward, I think AI will be like having a super-smart junior developer on my team, great for brainstorming and catching dumb syntax errors, but I'll still need my own solid foundation to verify its suggestions. In my future job, I'll probably use it for routine coding tasks so I can focus on the bigger architecture decisions, but I know I can't rely on it completely since real-world problems often need more nuanced solutions than what AI provides.
